## Description

This website provides a weather report for any given city a user searches for and lets them know if it's comfortable outside. It is an exercise in writing JavaScript that utilizes server-side APIs -- namely https://openweathermap.org/.

## Deployment Link

A deployed version of this application can be found [here](https://thorulfr.github.io/weather-dashboard/).

## Installation

You can simply use the deployed version, if you'd like. If you want to tinker around, you can clone or fork the source code from this applications' repository on GitHub.

## Tests

The following tests have been implemented for this application:

I used Jest as the testing framework for this application. The following tests were implemented: Dummy test 1, Dummy test 2, Dummy test 3

## Usage

Simply enter the city for which you'd like to see the weather. A five-day forecast will be displayed alongside a message that tells you whether or not you should go outside based on how comfortable the weather is. You can click through your recent searches to populate them once more.
